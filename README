Project 4

This project goes through a parse tree and creates an assembly code file.

First you must compile the program using the following command (within the program folder):

    make

To run the program, run the following command:

    ./compfs [file]

Where file is an optional command. Without it, you can type a program in on the terminal or redirect your file. This assumes that file has the suffix ".sp2022". The program will create a file in the target language.

To clean the folder, run the following command:

    make clean

Some things of note:

Project 3

LOCAL OPTION

This project simulates static semantics for a compiler. This program will check to make sure identifiers are properly declared.

First you must compile the program using the following command (within the program folder):

    make

To run the program, run the following command:

    ./statSem [file]

Where file is an optional command. Without it, you can type a program in on the terminal or redirect your file. This assumes that file has the suffix ".sp2022".

To clean the folder, run the following command:

    make clean

Some things of note:
    - For some reason, my program can't pick up undeclared variables that around placed in parentheses [x: yell ( z ) ;] will not be recognized for some reason if z hasn't been declared.
    - fixed space issue in parse tree
    - fixed closing parentheses error
    - fixed issue in N where i was assigning child1 twice
    - fixed issue where an empty vars was stil returning a node
    - fixed an error in where my loops weren't formatting correctly
